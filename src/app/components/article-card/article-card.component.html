                In my experience there is confusion between what I would consider a Unit Test and an
                Integration Test for an Angular Component. Drawing on my OO development experience and
                having practised Test-driven development for a number of years in Angular & Java (plus
                other languages & frameworks), I think I can help reduce the 'grey' in the landscape.
