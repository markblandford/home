# Threat Modelling with Threat Dragon

This post is about how to perform Threat Modelling using the [STRIDE model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model). I'll highlight some of the nuances with using [OWASP Threat Dragon](https://owasp.org/www-project-threat-dragon/).

## What is Threat Modelling

Threat modelling is a critical part of a secure development lifecycle. We use a model, such as [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model), to help us identify, review and mitigate potential threats and vulnerabilities within a software system (or application).

The goal is to identify and mitigate threats early, before they become problems. It is critical that everyone in the team responsible for the software application is involved, as everyone can bring a different perspective. Furthermore, it helps educate all members of the team, as application security is everyone's responsibility.

## The STRIDE Threat Model

[STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model) is a threat classification model which was developed by Microsoft.

| Threat                      | Description                                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S**poofing                | Impersonating something or someone else.                                          |
| **T**ampering               | Modifying data or code, in transit or at rest.                                    |
| **R**epudiation             | Denying an action or transaction has taken place. Denying without accountability. |
| **I**nformation Disclosure  | Exposing data to unauthorised parties.                                            |
| **D**enial of Service (DoS) | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource.      |
| **E**levation of Privilege  | Gaining unauthorised access to resources or functionality.                        |

Each element within the system can be exposed to different threats in different ways. Furthermore, they could be exposed to multiple 'implementations' of the same threat. For example Denial of Service against a process, could come from a DDos attack or from an internal, malicious actor. Each would be represented as a different threat on that process.

## Threat Dragon

Threat Dragon is a free, open-source threat modelling tool developed by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/about/). It enables teams to visually develop the data flows of a system, and document threats and mitigations. It supports [STRIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model), which this article focuses on, and other threat models. The output of Threat Dragon is not only visual, but is in JSON, so can be easily added to any source control system.

### Getting Started

Threat Dragon is available in two ways:

1. üåê Web version - Simply use within the browser at [https://threatdragon.com](https://threatdragon.com).
2. üíª Desktop version - Available for download from the [OWASP Threat Dragon GitHub release page](https://github.com/OWASP/threat-dragon/releases).

Once you have it, you can start by creating a new model or importing an existing model. Depending on the threat model chosen, Threat Dragon will suggest the threats on each Data Flow or Process you add.

### Advice when using Threat Dragon

Threat Dragon is a little temperamental but once you get use to it, it is a great tool.

### Save Often

I find it is very easy to make a mistake, drag a Data Flow so it doesn't look like how you want it too. I've even had saves fail before and have had to start over. So **save your work regularly**.

### Selecting Data Flows

If you need to select an existing Data Flow in order to edit the details or threats to it, **click the Arrow Head**, not the line itself. Clicking the line, will...

### Adjusting the position of a Data Flow

Again a little tricky and often you'll find you just have to do a best-effort. If you want to add a 'corner' or a drag-point on a Data Flow, **click anywhere on the line**.

### Out-of-Scope Elements

If you mark a Process or Data Flow as out of scope, then click away and come back to the out-of-scope item before editing further. You'll find then, the item has changed and for example, you cannot add threats to it. Do include out-of-scope processes and data flows. By doing so, we're acknowledging their existence as a dependency, and so we can be aware if anything was to change, or for example, the out-of-scope element was known to be vulnerable, we could more easily see where our system could be exposed and what mitigations we should / have in place.

### Create all of the threats for each element even if Not Applicable

I find it beneficial to include every applicable threat to each process, data flow and store, even if there is no known threat or it's status is N/A. This demonstrates later that the threat was at least considered and not simply forgotten to be added.

### Review, review and review

The threats against a system are never static. Regularly review the threat model with the team, especially when new integrations are added. This helps keep everyone educated and aware plus offers the opportunity to close outstanding threats or create new ones.

### It is just JSON underneath

I've had models which when loaded, an error is displayed in Threat Dragon. The model is just JSON, so use other linting and validation tools to help resolve such issues.

If you're feeling brave, you can manually edit the JSON in a text editor. For example, if you want to rename something, you could use find-and-replace in a text editor.

### Components & Boundaries in Threat Dragon

When creating your threat model, there are different items you will use to represent your system:

| Item              | Description                                                       | Example use                           |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Actor üßç          | A user or external entity that perform against on the system.     | Customers, other applications or APIs |
| Data Flow ‚Ü©Ô∏è      | Represents the movement of data between elements.                 | HTTP requests, SQL queries            |
| Process üì¶        | Represents a component in the system that performs some function. | Web application, API, Auth provider   |
| Store üìÅ          | Where data is stored.                                             | Database, file system                 |
| Trust Boundary ü§ù | Represents a boarder where control or trust changes.              | Network zones, internal vs public     |

## Threats by item / element within a system

Now we know what the threat classifications are in STRIDE and where in the system they apply, we'll now look into those in more detail for each element in the system.

### Data Flow ‚Ü©Ô∏è

| Threat                     | Example                                                            | Potential Mitigations                                                |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tampering**              | A request is intercepted and altered.                              | Encryption (TLS), signing.                                           |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive information (PII, passwords) is sent in the request URL. | None. Redesign the system and include in the encrypted body instead. |
| **Denial of Service**      | Overwhelming the network.                                          | Load balancing, short connection timeouts.                           |

_I find DoS against the Data Flows as one of the hardest threats to consider and suggest mitigations for._

## Process üì¶

| Threat                      | Example                                                                      | Potential Mitigations                                                                                              |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spoofing**                | A malicious actor is able to gain access as another user of the application. | MFA, password hygiene, least-privilege.                                                                            |
| **Tampering**               | Code is maliciously modified with the application.                           | Signed commits, PRs requiring approval, [SAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing). |
| **Repudiation**             | A malicious actor deletes resources from the application and denies it.      | All actions attributed in audit logs, recording IP addresses etc.                                                  |
| **Information Disclosure**  | An API exposes infrastructure details in error messages and logs.            | Sanitize error messages, logs.                                                                                     |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | An API is overwhelmed with requests causing it to become unresponsive.       | Rate limiting, Load Balancing.                                                                                     |
| **Elevation of Privilege**  | A regular account is able to perform admin-level actions.                    | Enforce role-based access, least-privilege and regular reviews.                                                    |

## Store üìÅ

| Threat                      | Example                                                                                      | Potential Mitigations                                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Tampering**               | A malicious actor is able to change stored, customer data.                                   | Access controls, encryption at rest and in while in use, backups.          |
| **Repudiation**             | A malicious actor changes data and it is not possible to attribute the action to them.       | Enabling audit logs.                                                       |
| **Information Disclosure**  | The data is stored unencrypted and accessible to unauthorised people.                        | Encryption (rest, in use and transit), only store the minimum required.    |
| **Denial of Service (DoS)** | A poorly constructed query is able to be run and causes the database to become unresponsive. | Prevent direct access, optimise queries, real-time performance monitoring. |

## An Example

Here is a small, not very detailed example of a web application, which

1. Uses a 3rd party authentication provider (out of scope).
2. Communicates with a trusted API, which is considered a part of the software system.
3. This API stores data in a database.

![Example Threat Model](/assets/articles/threat-modelling/example-threat-model.png "Example Threat Model in Threat Dragon")

### Steps

1. Create the data flow / model of the application flow within your software system.
   1. If it's large, consider breaking it down and create, smaller separate threat models for logic parts of the flow. Threat Dragon can have multiple models within the same 'parent' model.
2. Analysis each process, store & data flow following STRIDE.
   1. When you have an element selected, clicking '+ New Threat' will at first default to adding the applicable threats for the element selected. However, you don't have to stick with this, feel free to add more as you see fit.

### The documented threats for the example

#### Out-of Scope

1. Customer / browser - In this example, I've marked the customer as being out-of-scope as we cannot control customer behaviour or their browser. This will not always be the case however.
2. 3rd Party Auth Provider - We assume it is secure but fundamentally it is not our responsibility to ensure it is, as it is maintained by a 3rd, trusted party.

#### Processes

##### Web App (frontend) üì¶

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | A malicious actor is able to gain access as another user of the application. | üü¢ Mitigated | Tokens are only stored in secure, httpOnly, SameSite cookies so cannot be accessed by anything else. XSS & CSP is in use too. |
| **Tampering** | Modifying data or code. | üü¢ Mitigated | üîí Code reviews, signed commits, and access controls are enforced. No data is stored with the Frontend application. |
| **Repudiation** | Denying an action or transaction has taken place. Denying without accountability. | üü¢ Mitigated | üìú Audit logs are maintained with user identifiers. All commits must be signed |
| **Information Disclosure** | Some, customer information is stored in the browser local storage. | üî¥ Open (High) | Avoid using localStorage or sessionStorage. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate users from accessing a service or resource. | üü¢ Mitigated | ‚öñÔ∏è Uses CDN caching and load balancing. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorised access to resources or functionality. | üü¢ Mitigated | üîë Authorisation checks are carried out and there is no concept of roles within the application. Control to the infrastructure of the application and code is access controlled following least-privilege. |

---

##### Backend API üì¶

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Spoofing** | A malicious actor is able to gain access as another user of the application. | üî¥ Open (High) | CORS is used to limit access to just the Web App domain. However, no authorisation checks are carried out on the requests using the JWT, meaning anyone with a valid JWT can impersonate another customer. |
| **Tampering** | Modifying data or code. | üü¢ Mitigated | üîí Signed commits, code reviews, and access controls. No data is stored with the API. |
| **Repudiation** | Denying an action or transaction has taken place. Denying without accountability. | üü¢ Mitigated | üìú Log all requests with user ID from the JWT and associated actions. |
| **Information Disclosure** | A 500 error response shows the stack trace, which exposes the language the API is written in etc. | üî¥ Open (Medium) | Return generic or sanitised error responses. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource. | üü¢ Mitigated | ‚öñÔ∏è Rate limiting, load balancing, and request timeouts. |
| **Elevation of Privilege** | Gaining unauthorised access to resources or functionality. | üü¢ Mitigated | üîë Role-based access control and least privilege enforced at the API code & infrastructure. |

---

#### Stores

##### üìÅ Internal Database

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tampering** | Queries or stored data could be manipulated. | üî¥ Open (High) | Use parameterised queries, restrict database accounts, and enforce strict schema validation. |
| **Repudiation** | Denying an action or transaction has taken place. Denying without accountability. | üü¢ Mitigated | üìú Database logs are maintained. |
| **Information Disclosure** | Personally identifiable information stored in plain text. | üî¥ Open (High) | Encrypt sensitive fields at rest & while in use. Ensure there are strict access controls to the database. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource. | üü¢ Mitigated | ‚öñÔ∏è Apply query limits, use indexes, and enable monitoring and alerts. |

---

#### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Data Flows

##### POST /api/{username}/order - üì¶ Web App ‚Üî üì¶ Backend API

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tampering** | Modifying data or code, in transit. | üü¢ Mitigated | TLS encryption. |
| **Information Disclosure** | Sensitive data (e.g. usernames) is included in URLs (`/api/{username}/order`). | üî¥ Open (High) | Remove identifiers from URLs; pass data in request body or claims. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource. | üü¢ Mitigated | ‚öñÔ∏è Rate limiting and API gateway protections. |

---

##### Authenticate - üì¶ Web App ‚Üî üì¶ Third-Party Authentication Provider

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tampering** | Modifying data or code, in transit. | üü¢ Mitigated | Verify PKCE challenge and state value. |
| **Information Disclosure** | Exposing data to unauthorised parties. | üü¢ Mitigated | TLS & no sensitive data is included in the request. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource. | ‚ö™ N/A | Documented as a third-party dependency risk. However, if they suffer a DoS, what impact will it have on us? |

---

##### Verify JWT - üì¶ Backend API ‚Üî üì¶ Third-Party Authentication Provider

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tampering** | TLS 1.1 is used, which is now considered insecure. | üî¥ Open (Medium) | TLS encryption with integrity checks. |
| **Information Disclosure** | Exposing data to unauthorised parties. | üü¢ Mitigated | Although only TLS 1.1 & no sensitive data is included in the request. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource. | ‚ö™ N/A | Documented as a third-party dependency risk. However, if they suffer a DoS, what impact will it have on us? |

---

##### Queries - üì¶ Backend API ‚Üî üìÅ Internal Database

| Threat | Risk | Status | Mitigation |
|--------|------|--------|------------|
| **Tampering** | The request is made without SSL enabled, exposing the credentials and query in the request and response. | üî¥ Open (Low) | This is an issue but the communication is internal, as the database is on 10.0.0.0 private address space. Parametrised queries are also already in use. Enable SSL. |
| **Information Disclosure** | The request is made without SSL enabled, exposing the credentials and query in the request and response. | üî¥ Open (Low) | Enforce SSL on all database connections. |
| **Denial of Service** | Preventing legitimate people or processes from access a service or resource. | üü¢ Mitigated | ‚öñÔ∏è Resource limits, query monitoring, and real-time alerts are in place. |

## Conclusion

Hopefully this gives you a better idea about how to use Threat Dragon to perform threat modelling on your application environment.
